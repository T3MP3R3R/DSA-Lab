## Initial AVL Tree (by roll number)
        10
          \
           20
          /  \
        15    30
                 \
                  40
                    \
                     50

## Step 2: Check Balance

Node 20 is unbalanced (balance factor = -2, RL case)  
**Sol:** Right rotation on 30, then Left rotation on 10

---

## Step 3: Perform Rotations

Before first rotation:

    30
     \
      40
        \
         50

After first rotation:

       40
      /  \
     30   50

---

Before second rotation:

        10
          \
           20
          /  \
        15    40
              / \
             30 50


After second rotation:

          20
         /  \
       10    40
         \   / \
         15 30 50

---


---

## Step 4: Resulting AVL Tree

      20
     /  \
    10    40
     \   / \
     15 30 50


**Height of AVL Tree:** 3

## Notes

- AVL tree automatically balances using rotations after insertions
- Balance factor = height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)
- Rotations maintain the **O(log n)** height property of AVL trees
