**Q: Why AVL?**

A: AVL trees stay height-balanced so operations stay within O(log n). They prevent a BST from becoming skewed and slow.

**Q: Explain each step of the code: how nodes are linked to form the AVL, the types of temporary pointers used in rotation functions,
and how specific nodes (e.g., x, y, t2) correspond to the original tree nodes.**

A: x, y, and t2 are temporary pointers used in rotations:
- y = unbalanced node,
- x = its child that becomes the new root,
- t2 = subtree that gets moved.

**Q: Specify the type of rotation performed (right, left, or double rotation), and explain which node is returned at the end of the function and why.**

A: The rotation returns the new root of the AVL subtree — 6 in A and 16 in B.
<br> This happens because the unbalanced root (10) is pushed down one level.
<br> AVL logic always returns the topmost node after rotation so height remains correct.
<br> Thus, this returned pointer is now the balanced AVL root.
